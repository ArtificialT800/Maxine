# Maxine

**Maxine**, your personal Minecraft PvP training bot. Maxine is designed to help players practice their combat skills in a controlled and consistent environment. 

I created Maxine back in late 2021. Used to play online on several servers, but I was terrible at PvP. So got to working on her, and I was pretty satisifed with the results. (Yes, I have gotten better at PvP now)

## Installation

To get started with Maxine, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download Node.js from [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ArtificialT800/Maxine.git
   cd Maxine
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start Maxine, simply run the following command:

```
node Maxine.js
```

Maxine will automatically connect to your Minecraft server and be ready for PvP training. Once Maxine is running, you can type the `fight me` in the Minecraft chat. 
`come here` would ask Maxine to come to your position.
